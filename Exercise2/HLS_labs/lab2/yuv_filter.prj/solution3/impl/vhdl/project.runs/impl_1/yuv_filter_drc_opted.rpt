2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP yuv_filter_rgb2yuv_U0/bound_reg_612_reg input A B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP yuv_filter_rgb2yuv_U0/bound_reg_612_reg output P is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP yuv_filter_yuv2rgb_U0/bound_reg_639_reg output P is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning
Output pipelining  
DSP yuv_filter_yuv_scale_U0/bound_reg_301_reg output P is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 output will improve performance. Both multiplier/adder output can be pipelined.
Related violations: <none>

NDRV-2#1 Warning
Out of context terminal  
Port in_channels_ch1_address1[0], ap_rst, ap_start, in_height[15:0], in_width[15:0], in_channels_ch3_q0[7:0], in_channels_ch2_q0[7:0], in_channels_ch1_q0[7:0], ap_ready, in_channels_ch1_address0[21:0], in_channels_ch1_ce0, out_channels_ch3_d0[7:0], out_channels_ch1_d0[7:0], ap_done, out_height_ap_vld (the first 15 of 25 listed) does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS property, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal %ELG. Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate and no routing information for this port can be exported.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
