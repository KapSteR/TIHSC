		The processing platform chosen for this project is a \emph{ZYBO Zynqâ„¢-7000 Development Board} from Digilent (see Figure \ref{fig:ZYBO}).
		The brains of the ZYBO is a Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable System on a Chip (AP SoC).
		The AP SoC (see Figure \ref{fig:ZynqArch}) features both a Processing System (PS) consisting of 650 MHz dual core ARM\textregistered{} Cortex A9 CPU with dedicated I/O and Memory and extensible FPGA Programmable Logic (PL) for HW synthesis.

		This enables the construction of a system with software, written in C++, running on the CPU, and with dedicated hardware for acceleration of computation and I/O handling.

		Alongside the AP SoC the ZYBO features a range external hardware for power supply/management and interfacing.
		It has push-buttons, throw-switches and LEDs for direct interface, USB-OTG, UART-to-USB and Ethernet for communication and HDMI, VGA and audio in/out out for Audio/Visual.

		Lastly, the ZYBO features six PMOD GPIO ports along the perimeter (see Figure \ref{fig:ZYBO}), one directly connected to the PS and the others accessible through the PL.
		They deliver 3.3V power to external devices as well as eight customizable 1.8V or 3.3V digital I/O ports each (see Figure \ref{fig:pmod}).
		These are used for interfacing with the sensor and motor (see Section \fxnote{ref to sensors} and \fxnote{ref to mortors}, respectively).

		\subsubsection{HW/SW Co-Design} % (fold)
		\label{ssub:hw_sw_co_design}

			The availability of FPGA logic on-chip enables rapid prototyping of HW acceleration blocks, through the use of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools.
			Using HLS one can specify some desired functionality in C++/SystemC code and directly synthesize it to HW-blocks to be implemented in FPGA logic, without needing to explicitly design HW.

			This is utilized for creating a PWM motor controller, described in Section \fxnote{ref to PWM controller HLS}.
