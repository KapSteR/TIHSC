\label{cha:introduction}

	This report contains a summary of the course material and a description of the project work from the course "AI in Robotics".
	The first part of the report covers the course theory, which is mainly based on the Udacity course named "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics".
	The second part covers the project work, where the theory is put into practice.
	Here, a robot capable of localizing itself in a pre-defined environment, is constructed.

	LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is used for distance sensing, in order to obtain information about the environment, as distances in all horizontal directions in 1\degree\ intervals.

	The project is built on a ZYBO platform, which contains a Processing System with a dual-core ARM processor and reprogrammable FPGA logic.
	Therefore the challenges of the project is not only to do localization, but also to learn the chosen platform.
