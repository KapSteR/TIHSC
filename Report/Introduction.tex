This report contains a summary of the course material and a description of the project work from the course "AI in Robotics".

The first part of the report covers the course theory, which is mainly based on the Udacity course named "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics".

The second part covers the project work, where the theory is put into practice.
Here, a robot is capable of localizing itself in a pre-defined environment, is constructed.

A LIDAR is used as a distance sensor, in order to obtain distance information about the environment from 360\degree with 1\degree intervals.
The project is build on a ZYBO, which contains a core with both reprogrammable logic and a dual arm processor.
Therefore the challenges of the project is not only to do localization, but also to learn the chosen platform.
