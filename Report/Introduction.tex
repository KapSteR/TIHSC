This report contains a a summary of the course material and a description of the project work conducted in the course AI in Robotics.

The first part of the report covers the course theory, which is mainly based on the Udacity course named "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics".

The second part covers the project work, where the theory is put into practice.
Here, a robot capable of localizing itself in a pre-defined environment, is constructed.

A LIDAR is uses as a distance sensor, in order to obtain 360 degree information about the distance to the environment.
The project is build on a Zybo7000 board, which contains a core with both reprogrammable logic and a dual arm processor.
Therefore the challenges of the project is not only to do localization, but also to learn the chosen platform.
