\section{Kalman} % (fold)
	\label{sec:kalman}
In this section the theory about basic Kalman Filter (KF) and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) will be introduced.
\subsection{The Kalman Filter}
The KF is a technique for filtering and predicting a linear system \fxnote{ref til bogen}. 
It can be extended to also work on non-linear system, thus the EFK. 
The basic KF operates in two states; the prediction state and the correction state, sometimes also called the time update state and the measurement update state.
